# PasswordFromDatabaseDemo

App created in Android Studio 3.0.1 and tested on a Genymotion Google Nexus 5X Android Emulator then on a Motorola Moto X Developer Edition Android phone.

To use this app the user just clicks the 'Password From Database Demo' app icon and they are taken right into the app. 
They are greeted with a group of items in the middle of the app with a white background screen. On the top of the group
on the left side is some text that tells you to "Enter Password" (TextView). Then right below is a line (PlainText) where
you would enter in your password. Followed by a 'Submit' button on the lower right hand area with a transparent background.

The user clicks the PlainText line and a keyboard pops up. They enter in their password and if correct are taken to another screen.
But if they are wrong the 'Enter Password' changes to a 'Wrong Password' and they have to try again. When they put in the correct
password they are greeted with a white background screen with the text 'Welcome Password Correct' (TextView).
